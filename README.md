#DietGuard: Allergy & Restriction Checker

In this Google Chrome extension, we have developed a way for users to quickly locate if there are allergens or other restricted ingredients present in the food they are purchasing online. With online shopping for groceries, it can be challenging to locate where the ingredients are located on a website. This user-friendly extension allows users to search through websites for multiple allergens and even provides highlighting of the restricted ingredients for easy viewing.

This extension was developed in a way to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion, especially in the food space. The tool that we have created provides an opportunity for people who may have a lot of allergies or dietary restrictions to safely shop for groceries online. This extension can even help individuals quickly identify restricted foods on recipe websites to save time. 

The DietGuard: Allergy & Restriction Checker Extension was developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
